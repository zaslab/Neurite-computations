Note:
Dataset S1 is 'Supplementary file 1': A matlab file containing the network data used for all of the analyses.

Dataset S2 is 'Supplementary file 2': A csv table with the list of neural pairs with significant synaptic clustering.

Dataset S3 is 'Supplementary file 3': A csv table with the results used for detecting tightly-clustered synapses of pairs of neurons on a common third neuron.

Dataset S4 is 'Supplementary file 4': A list of the top common neurons and the number of significant triplets that they form.
